# Language Server Provider

LSP is a new standard which makes it easier for editors to support
advanced features in a portable way.

In brief a "language server" provides the ability to show help,
provide completions, etc, and a users' editor just needs to speak the
appropriate protocol to get all those features - without implementing them
directly.

## LSP Features

We support a minimal LSP implementation that:

* Provides completion for the names of all standard-library functions.
* Shows information on standard-library functions, on hover.
